# Q5  The medical records of the male diabetic patents reporting to a clinic during one year provide the
# following percentage:
#           | Light case          | Serious case
#------------------------------------------------------
# Age of    | Diabetes in parents | Diabetes in parents
# patient   | Yes      |       No | Yes     |        No 
#------------------------------------------------------
# Below 40  | 15               10 | 8       |         2
#------------------------------------------------------
# Above 40  | 15               20 | 20      |        10

# Suppose a patient is chosen at random from this group, and the events A, B and C are defined
# A: He has a serious case.
# B: He is below 40.
# C: His parents are diabetic

## Total number of patients are 100, so every element divided by 100 to get Probability

# (a) Find the probabilities P(A), P(B), P(A ∩ B), P(A ∩ B ∩ C).

## P(A)
.4

## P(B)
.35

## P(A ∩ B)
.1

## P(A ∩ B ∩ C) 
.08

# (b) Describe the following events verbally and find their probabilities: 
## (i) A' ∩ B'
## patients that are not serious and not below 40
.35

## (ii) A'∪C'
## Patient that are not serious or with parents that are not diabetic 
.72

## (iii) A' ∩ B ∩ C'
## patients that are not serious, below 40 and parents are not diabetic
.1
